## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

## Setup

### Environments

See `env/readme.md` for instructions on setting up environment variables. The following environments are required to run the scripts in `package.json` (these can be renamed to anything, however, be sure to edit the package.json scripts to use your custom environment names):

- `dev-test` : All test scripts use this environment, as well as the GitHub workflow.
- `dev` : All start scripts (except `start:prod`) use this environment.

### ESLint

This project uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to catch problems in the code. The settings are defined in `.eslintrc.js`.

### Prettier

This project uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to automatically format code. The settings are defined in `.prettierrc`.

### GitHub

This repository is a template repository. You can create a new repository based on this one by clicking `Use this template > Create a new repository` at the top of the GitHub repository.

`.github/workflows/build-and-test.yml` contains a GitHub Actions workflow for automatically running tests when a pull request is opened. It creates a local postgreSQL database to run the tests. The workflow relies on an actions secret that you must define at `Settings > Security > Secrets and variables > Actions > New repository secret`. Name the secret `ENV_DEV_TEST`. See the `Environments` section above for setting up the properties in this secret. This is basically an env file stored on GitHub. The workflow will grab this secret and convert it into a file named `env/.env.dev-test` for use in the testing step.

## Modules

### AppModule

This is the root module that starts the application. The AppController provides basic information about the app. The following routes are available:

- `/` : Returns a 'Hello World!' message along with an HTTP status of 200 for verifying the app is running.
- `/env` : Returns what environment (e.g., test, prod, etc.) the app is currently running in.

### AuthModule

This module provides authentication services. See the `Authentication` section below for more details. The following routes are available:

- `/auth/signup` : Registers a new user in the database.
- `/auth/login` : If user is registered, returns an access token (for accessing authenticated routes) and a refresh token (for obtaining a new access token after it expires).
- `/auth/logout` : Invalidates the user's refresh token. The user will need to login to obtain new tokens.
- `/auth/refresh` : Refreshes the access and refresh tokens.

### LogModule

This module exports a custom LogService that can be used in other modules for application logging. By default, logging is turned off in the `dev-test` environment (the environment that all tests are run on). If you want to turn logging off in any other environment, add the property `LOGS=false` to the appropriate env file.

### CoreModule

This module is intended to house all the core services that the application provides so that all related entities are together in one module. The module contains a `Thing` entity that serves as a template for creating controllers, services, entities, DTOs, and unit tests.

### Shared directory

This directory (not a module) contains files that are consumed/shared by the other modules.

## Authentication

The AuthModule provides authentication services for the app. To add authentication to any module, import the AuthModule and add the following decorator to the controller or route:

```typescript
// Add authentication to example.module.ts
@Module({
  imports: [AuthModule]
})
export class ExampleModule {}

// Authenticate all routes in example.controller.ts
@UseGuards(AccessTokenGuard)
@Controller('/example')
export class ExampleController {}

// Authenticate only this specific route
@UseGuards(AccessTokenGuard)
@Get()
getAll() {}
```

Any route with this decorator will require an access JSON Web Token (JWT) to proceed. Use the `/api/auth/signup` and `api/auth/login` routes to obtain the access token. If you do not want authentication, you can simply delete the AuthModule and remove its import statement in the other modules.

## Abstract entities

### Base entity

The Base entity is an abstract entity containing properties that should apply to all entities, like `createDate` and `updateDate`. If there are other properties that should apply to all entities, add them to this class and have all entities extend from Base.

### User-owned entity

The UserOwned entity represents an object that is owned by a specific user in the database. For example, if this was a To-do list application, each user would own any to-do item that they saved in the database. When querying the database for to-do items, you would only want to return items owned by that user. Extending this entity simplifies the process of tying an object to a user.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Test

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```
